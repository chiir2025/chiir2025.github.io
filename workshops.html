			<h1>Workshops at CHIIR 2025</h1>
			<p>We have two planned workshops for CHIIR 2025. Full details of
			each workshop are available on its own website (links
			below). The workshops will run on the 27th and 28th March
			2025. Registration costs are complimentary with a registration
			for the main conference</p>
		
		<h1>Workshop:Access for Heads Up Computing (DIMIRA-HUC)</h1>
		<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/chiirdimirahuc">Workshop Website</a></p> 

<p>The advancement of wearable intelligent systems presents a transformative opportunity to revolutionize human interaction with digital content. This workshop explores how information seeking, retrieval and access could be designed and implemented in the new Heads-Up Computing interaction paradigm. The primary objective is to support tasks requiring rapid information seeking, retrieval and access in dynamic settings while maintaining a "heads-up" user experience, ensuring engagement with the real world. This half-day workshop aims to explore the opportunities and challenges of utilising multimodal inputs such as voice, gaze, and gestures to deliver real-time, hands-free access to digital information, enabling seamless and efficient interactions for human-centric information access. The workshop will focus on sharing research outcomes and best practices, fostering community collaboration, and stimulating discussions on overcoming current challenges. By addressing both theoretical advancements and practical applications, it seeks to propel this rapidly evolving field forward. We warmly invite everyone interested in this topic to join us, share insights, and participate in meaningful discussions as we explore the future of wearable intelligent systems and Heads-Up Computing.</p>

<h1>Workshop: NeuroPhysIIR Workshop at CHIIR 2025</h1>
<p><a href="https://neurophysiir.github.io/chiir2025/">Workshop website</a></p>
<p>The NeuroPhysIIR workshop at CHIIR 2025 aims to bring together
experts and non-experts interested in advancing knowledge on how to
effectively use neurophysiological signals captured with multiple
wearable devices to characterize cognitive and affective processes
that occur when we interact with information access systems, including
search engines, recommender systems, and conversational
assistants. The workshop aims to lower the entry barrier to this
research area, and researchers and practitioners without experience in
any of the disciplines involved (cognitive science, information
science, wearable computing, etc.) are particularly welcomed.</p>
