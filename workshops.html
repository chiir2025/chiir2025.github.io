			<h1>Workshops and Tutorials at CHIIR 2025</h1>
			<p>We have two planned workshops and three planned tutorials for
			CHIIR 2025. Full details of each workshop are available on its
			own website (links	below). The workshops and tutorials will run
			on the 27th and 28th March 2025. Registration costs are
			complimentary with a registration for the main conference. This
			page lists both workshops and both tutorials.</p>

<h1>Workshop: NeuroPhysIIR Workshop at CHIIR 2025</h1>
<h3>Full-day workshop</h3>
			<p><b>Date:</b>Thursday 27th March, all day</p>
<p><a href="https://neurophysiir.github.io/chiir2025/">Workshop website</a></p>
<p>The NeuroPhysIIR workshop at CHIIR 2025 aims to bring together
experts and non-experts interested in advancing knowledge on how to
effectively use neurophysiological signals captured with multiple
wearable devices to characterize cognitive and affective processes
that occur when we interact with information access systems, including
search engines, recommender systems, and conversational
assistants. The workshop aims to lower the entry barrier to this
research area, and researchers and practitioners without experience in
any of the disciplines involved (cognitive science, information
science, wearable computing, etc.) are particularly welcomed.</p>

		<h1>Workshop: Access for Heads Up Computing (DIMIRA-HUC)</h1>
<h3>Half-day workshop</h3>
		<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/chiirdimirahuc">Workshop
			Website</a></p>
			<p><b<Date:</b> 28th March, morning</p>
<p>The advancement of wearable intelligent systems presents a transformative opportunity to revolutionize human interaction with digital content. This workshop explores how information seeking, retrieval and access could be designed and implemented in the new Heads-Up Computing interaction paradigm. The primary objective is to support tasks requiring rapid information seeking, retrieval and access in dynamic settings while maintaining a "heads-up" user experience, ensuring engagement with the real world. This half-day workshop aims to explore the opportunities and challenges of utilising multimodal inputs such as voice, gaze, and gestures to deliver real-time, hands-free access to digital information, enabling seamless and efficient interactions for human-centric information access. The workshop will focus on sharing research outcomes and best practices, fostering community collaboration, and stimulating discussions on overcoming current challenges. By addressing both theoretical advancements and practical applications, it seeks to propel this rapidly evolving field forward. We warmly invite everyone interested in this topic to join us, share insights, and participate in meaningful discussions as we explore the future of wearable intelligent systems and Heads-Up Computing.</p>

<h1>Tutorial: Applying Large Language Models to Interactive Information Retrieval: A Practical Exploration</h1>
<h3>Half-day tutorial</h3>
<p><b>Date:</b> Thursday 27th March</p>
<p>This half-day interactive tutorial provides researchers with practical skills to use large language models (LLMs) for interactive information retrieval research. Through hands-on exercises and real-world research examples, participants will learn to set up LLMs locally, integrate them via APIs, and evaluate their outputs. The tutorial will explain which models suit specific research needs, offering participants a robust toolkit to enhance their work. Attendees will also gain insights into the latest developments in the field, ensuring they stay at the forefront of innovation. Ideal for researchers eager to explore new methodologies in information retrieval, this tutorial offers foundational knowledge and cutting-edge strategies to use LLMs in interactive information retrieval research.</p>

<h1>Tutorial: Transdisciplinarity for human information interaction
and retrieval: Strategies for collaborating across research
disciplines to foster societal impact</h1>
<h3>Half-day tutorial</h3>
<p><b>Date:</b> Thursday 27th March</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.joannkcattlin.com/acm-chiir-2025-tutorial">Tutorial Website</a></p>
<p>Undertaking collaborative research across disciplines, and with
external stakeholders, requires researchers to navigate complex
research designs. Transdisciplinary research designs involve
integration across methodological paradigms, including qualitative,
quantitative, experimental, and textual approaches. However,
researchers often design projects within their own paradigms, without
the expertise needed to effectively integrate paradigmatic
approaches. This half-day tutorial introduces human information interaction and retrieval researchers to the powerful insights possible through working across research paradigms, including involving qualitative social scientists and humanities scholars and external partners in research design. The session provides practical guidance and tools for developing and conducting transdisciplinary research projects that foster societal impact.</p>

<h1>Tutorial: Responsible AI From the Lens of an Information Retrieval
Researcher: A Hands-On Tutorial</h1>
<h3>Half-day tutorial</h3>
<p><b>Date:</b> Friday 28th March</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.damianospina.com/tutorial/responsible-ai/">Tutorial Website</a></p>
I keep hearing about Responsible AI...but what does it really mean in
practice?" This hands-on half-day tutorial aims to explore concepts such as positionality, participatory research, fairness and diversity, and ethics by illustrating them through case studies based on existing research in the field of information retrieval. The purpose of the tutorial is to raise awareness of responsible practices and help attendees apply these practices in their own research.</p>
